# Final-project
So our project is a blockchain system. The idea of the name was born through the hope of coming back to our lives before the covid19....

Command line Interface for covidcoins powered by Ali & Martina. 
This is a command line interface with mnemonic private key generator for the Symbol Blockchain provided by NEM. 

This project is connected with the course "Informatics for Economy and Finance" aka "Blockchain Technology" - CdL Informatica Unversit√† della Calabria UNICAL.
